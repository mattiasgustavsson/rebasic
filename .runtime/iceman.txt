System Requirements:

- MIDI playback software capable of reading Type 1 Standard
    MIDI File format
- General MIDI sound device (Wave Table or better recommended)


This Standard MIDI File was recorded directly from Sierra's "CODENAME:
ICEMAN" adventure game.  It has been converted from the Roland MT-32
version for playback on General MIDI sound cards.  A Wave Table or better
sound card is highly recommended for optimal playback.
